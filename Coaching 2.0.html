    <p class="text_column">Overview: Stealth and disabling other heroes make Sombra a powerful infiltrator. The hack can disrupt her enemies, making it easy for her and the team to take that person out. While her EMP hacks every enemy within range, giving the upper hand to her team. Sombra's ability to translocate and camouflage makes her a hard target to pin down. She may lack in damage, but using her abilities can help even the odds with her enemies.
</p>
    <p class="text_column">The things I'm going over are to help give beginner players an idea of how this hero works. Overwatch is a hard game to get into because there are so many choices to make, the information shown will put those new players one step ahead of other new players. It won´t be too difficult to pick up on her as long as you understand the way she should be played.

    <p class="text_column">Hopefully my explanations can help you climb up the ladder </p>

      <p>Strategy: Sombra has a passive playstyle, unlike most other dps heroes. The goal that each player should have is to give the enemy team a difficult time. The hacking ability does just that. Some heroes greatly depend on their abilities, like Doomfist, Tracer, and Wrecking ball, when they get hacked there is nothing they can do but hope for survival because they have nothing to protect themselves with.
The main characters that you should focus on hacking are the enemy shield tanks because they won´t have a barrier to protect their team if they are hacked. The easiest way to do so is to use stealth and get behind the enemy team, reappear and hack the tank and then have your team focus fire on that tank. </p>

      <p>Sombra translocator can be used as a get out of jail free card because as long as it is active the player can always get back to safety. the best way to use it is to leave it on a health pack away from the fight, while you are in the enemy backline and you take heavy damage you can teleport out and heal back up and just repeat.
But her main power comes from EMP, as it wipes away everyone´s abilities when caught in the blast, one of her main objectives is to charge her emp as fast as she can so she can use it as much as possible. The best way to use EMP is to coordinate an attack with your team, either by combing it with another ult or to have everyone push in at one time. </p>

    <p class="hero_header">Simply, the steps to Sombra are:
</p>
    <div class="button">place translocator on health pack
Use stealth to get behind the enemy line safely
Get out of stealth and hack an enemy tank
Do damage with your pistol to gain ult charge
Use the translocator to get back to safety
Repeat until EMP is ready to use, once it is coordinate an attack and go in.</div>
