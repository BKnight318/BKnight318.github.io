    <h2 class="hidden">About</h2>
    <p class="text_column">Overwatch 5v5 first-person shooter in which players fight to complete an objective. There are three roles which teams build their compositions with. Each role has a unique part to play to give a team its best chance at winning.
 </p>
	 
    <p class="text_column">This page will be aimed directly towards the support role.
		<br>
I believe support is the most important role in overwatch,
		<br>
 it is important for these characters to be understood and played correctly in order for a game to go well.</p>

		<p>(clip 1
a clip of me as mercy navigating a team fight talking about good positioning)</p>
      <p>A really important aspect of Mercy’s playstyle is uptime. Mercy brings value to the team just by being alive.

Every mercy player should value their own life over others, meaning mercy players shouldn’t put themselves in dangerous situations.

Use cover as an advantage, every object that blocks off enemy sight line is your friend, DO NOT STAND IN THE OPEN</p>

      <h3>Beam Priority</h3>
      <img src="images/placeholder.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="200" class="cards"/>
		<p>(clip2 I would display how powerful damage boost is compared to how strong a hero is without it)
</p>
      <p>Mercy's main value comes directly from her damage boost. Although she can heal, every mercy player should prioritize damage boosting rather than healing.
Good Damage boost targets include heroes that have high burst damage(high damage over a short time):
-Ashe, Soldier 76, Phara, Sojourn, echo
While damage boosting is a main priority, mercy also should be keeping the other support alive. Always watch out if your other support is getting pressured, and help out as much as you can in order to keep them safe.</p>
