		<p>The article begins with an explanation of the term esports, stating a comparison that it's the same as physical professional sports with the exception that video gamers uphold the competion instead.

		<p>KcCreation’s review. I mostly agree with the review; the ranked system is not very good, but I dont agree with how they complain about having bronze teammates vs masters. They went on about how their teammates always suck, while the enemy is always carrying, but the truth is, we as people remember the bad games over everything else, not every games is like that, if you do your part, your team has a higher probability of winning bc its 4 against 5 chances of bad teammates. I agree with the part that goes over balance changes, the devs wont listen to the community and they over-buff heroes especially when the meta shifts, bc heroes that didnt do well in that meta, werent bad, the meta just didnt favor them, now since the meta shifted they may be overpowered bc the devs wont stop microbuffing them.</p>

	  <p>This computer looks nice because it has the most recent graphic card, 4070ti, with intel i7 137000, along withSSD’s, and it looks cool, but in reality, id rather just build my own customs pc because of the price differences.</p>
      
        <a href="https://www.firstpost.com/sports/toxicity-in-video-games-analysing-cause-and-effects-of-abusive-online-behaviour-9613731.html">9/12/23</a> <p>Toxicity in gaming is described by the article to be “when a person becomes upset and begins to hurl abuse at other players”. It is important to understand the effects of toxicity because they can get psychologically harmful. It is hard to say what would be the most effective solution to removing or reducing toxicity in gaming. One of the most important points to keep in mind would be that most misbehaving players are only doing so because they have been exposed to abusive behaviour while gaming. Aslong as you do your part in staying friendly, there are more likely going to be fewer toxic people fighting with you.</p>
 <a href="https://overwatch-archive.fandom.com/wiki/San_Francisco_Shock">9/25/23</a>
		<p>Francisco Shock is one of the most well-known overwatch league teams. They won the 2019 championship in Overwatch League. One of the factors that made them a good team is their coaching. The coach, Crusty, is able to bring out the potential of almost all his players. Recently things for them went downhill, bad communication and team work have gone down. In order for them to be a good team, they need to figure some vocal things out.</p>
		<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/chatbots">10/16/23</a>
		<p>AI Chatbots are really interesting, the fact that computers are becoming more like humans is intriguing. In the article, a chatbot is discribed as a computer program that simulates human conversation with an end user. Chatbots make it easier to for users to find information and respond to questions without the need for human intervention or research. The article then goes on to explain more aspects of chatbots, like how they can be benifitial by saving time and work.
		<br>
		Although Chatbots make life easier, I believe they will make people less intelligent as time goes by. Yes they are very cool, but they make it so people dont have to work hard. If we relly on robots to do our work for us, we become more dependent on technoligy. This can result in reduced human interactions and social skills, which can lead to a less personal expirience. If chatbots also take over customer support, their will be less jobs for people to take over</p>
