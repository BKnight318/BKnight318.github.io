      <p>8/10/23-(https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/esports.asp) The article begins with an explanation of the term esports, stating a comparison that it's the same as physical professional sports with the exception that video gamers uphold the competion instead.

I mostly agree with the review; the ranked system is not very good, but I dont agree with how they complain about having bronze teammates vs masters. They went on about how their teammates always suck, while the enemy is always carrying, but the truth is, we as people remember the bad games over everything else, not every games is like that, if you do your part, your team has a higher probability of winning bc its 4 against 5 chances of bad teammates. I agree with the part that goes over balance changes, the devs wont listen to the community and they over-buff heroes especially when the meta shifts, bc heroes that didnt do well in that meta, werent bad, the meta just didnt favor them, now since the meta shifted they may be overpowered bc the devs wont stop microbuffing them.</p>

         9/12/23-(https://www.firstpost.com/sports/toxicity-in-video-games-analysing-cause-and-effects-of-abusive-online-behaviour-9613731.html) Toxicity in gaming is described by the article to be “when a person becomes upset and begins to hurl abuse at other players”. It is important to understand the effects of toxicity because they can get psychologically harmful. It is hard to say what would be the most effective solution to removing or reducing toxicity in gaming. One of the most important points to keep in mind would be that most misbehaving players are only doing so because they have been exposed to abusive behaviour while gaming. Aslong as you do your part in staying friendly, there are more likely going to be fewer toxic people fighting with you. iatur. </p>
