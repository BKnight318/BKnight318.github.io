    <h1>About Me </h1>
    <hr>
    <p dir="ltr">Gaming has been a part of my life for all that I can remember. My first ever platform was an Xbox 360, my mom got it for my 8th birthday. The games on it at that time were pretty simple, like Minecraft and N+, I didn't use it very much because I didn't find much enjoyment. My friend introduced me to the legendary game Black Ops II, and that's when I got into gaming. Yes, I was in 3rd grade playing Call of Duty. Even though my parents were a bit worried about me playing such a mature game at a young age, I was having the time of my life, which is what mattered.</p>
    <p>My new favorite game is Overwatch. I love team-based games, and overwatch incorporates that factor very well. There is a role for everyone's playstyle. The main heroes I play are Sombra and Ana, Sombra can take away other heroes' abilities, and ana has a sniper that heals allies. I feel like I've gotten pretty good at this game due to reaching high master's, the 2nd highest rank in competitive. I also enjoy playing Apex legends, I'm not a big fan of battle royal games, but the way this game incorporates the legends into the gameplay makes it fun. </p>
